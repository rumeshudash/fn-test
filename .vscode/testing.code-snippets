    // is left empty or omitted, the snippet gets applied to all languages. The prefix is what is
    // used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
    // $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders.
    // Placeholders with the same ids are connected.
